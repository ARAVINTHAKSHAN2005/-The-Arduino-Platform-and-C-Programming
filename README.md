#### Week 3 Assignemnt 
  * This file when uploaded to an Arduino will cause the in-built LED in pin 13 and any external led wired to pin 13 to blink, alternating between fast blinks and slow blinks
   The LED blinks 5 times quickly and then it blinks 5 more times slowly. When blinking quickly, the LED has a 1 second period, so it would be high for 0.5 seconds and low for 0.5 seconds. 
   When blinking slowly, the LED has a 4 second period, so it would be high for 2 seconds and low for 2 seconds.
